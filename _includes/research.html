              <p class="text-justify">A study led by St George's Hospital, University of London, in conjunction with researchers at the University of Cambridge, and the University of Manchester. I am currently working as a Research Associate for the Cambridge arm of the MLSE study. The study aims to develop a brief linguistic assessment tool to classify progressive aphasic syndromes. I will also use the MLSE to characterise language impairment in other types of dementia.</p>
